CTF: Whitehacks 2022

Difficulty: Hard

APOCALYPSE activated a sleeper cell for a suicide bombing but the target
location is not known.....

Experts from CSIT have discovered the attacker-controlled server that was used
to send a secret message to the sleeper cell. The server is protected with a
password that is at least 40 chars long! The server does not store the password
but to our good fortune, a weakness has been discovered in the way it performs
the authentication.

It validates the password by performing the following steps:

1. Split the 40 char password into 2 equally-sized segments
2. Check that the segments are not identical
3. Generate the SHA-256 digests of both segments
4. Check that the last 5 bytes of both digests are identical

Your task is to gain authentication to the server, decipher the message and
determine the target location before it's too late!

Enter the flag as `WH2022{ID_postal code}`

Eg. `WH2022{s@m_pl3_123456}`

## Solution

_Pwned by [@skytect](https://github.com/skytect)_

After visiting the site, one encounters a sign in page that requires a password.

> 1. Split the 40 char password into 2 equally-sized segments
> 2. Check that the segments are not identical
> 3. Generate the SHA-256 digests of both segments
> 4. Check that the last 5 bytes of both digests are identical

Looking at this, we can probably generate a working password by brute-force by
finding a valid hash collision. Here's the script I used:

```python
from hashlib import sha256
from itertools import product
from string import ascii_lowercase

endings = {}

for i, s in enumerate(product(ascii_lowercase, repeat = 20)):
    s = ''.join(s)
    h = sha256(s.encode()).hexdigest()
    ending = h[-10:]

    if ending in endings.keys():
        print(s, h)
        print(endings[ending][0], endings[ending][1])
        break
    else:
        endings[ending] = (s, h)

    if i % 1000000 == 0:
        print(f'Checked until {s}')
```

It can yield a match within 2 seconds on my computer:

```
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaachlhe acfaaf03622106a652c4d7a3b7d5703161c0ea0fbe15a7fc75f31fa68ebcad86
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaacgxur 957c4c3f3435548089a5f70d76a7331a2a47773e138d55e4c00bf7a68ebcad86
```

If we use the password `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaachlheaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacgxur`, we're able to
get past the authentication page.

On the site, we find the string:

```
UExBSU5URVhUIDw9PT4gKEFFUy1DQkMsIFNIQS0yNTYoMXN0IHNlZ21lbnQpLCBTSEEtMjU2KDJuZCBzZWdtZW50KSkgPD09PiBDSVBIRVJURVhU
```

After decoding it from Base64, we get:

```
PLAINTEXT <==> (AES-CBC, SHA-256(1st segment), SHA-256(2nd segment)) <==> CIPHERTEXT
```

This gives us a clue on how to deal with the other Base64 string hidden on the
site:

```
W4+OWR0rcN2cclkxSIWJBC0pYQMFZXbePsW+GrJFj6gfRNV1lXy6y3hUKhI8M2Tulm4RW9RZnWKlNt/ZpTfaB82Irx5wnYdg4kilZIDzAB9HNk+5hnqgqam/uhqbixIbOT8OxeRsQZ8pd16qMg+v/A==
```

First, let's generate the SHA-256 hashes of our passcode's components:

```
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaachlhe acfaaf03622106a652c4d7a3b7d5703161c0ea0fbe15a7fc75f31fa68ebcad86
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaacgxur 957c4c3f3435548089a5f70d76a7331a2a47773e138d55e4c00bf7a68ebcad86
```

Then, we can use the following values to attempt to decrypt the AES-CBC on
[CyberChef](<https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true)AES_Decrypt(%7B'option':'Hex','string':'acfaaf03622106a652c4d7a3b7d5703161c0ea0fbe15a7fc75f31fa68ebcad86'%7D,%7B'option':'Hex','string':'957c4c3f3435548089a5f70d76a7331'%7D,'CBC','Raw','Raw',%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D,%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D)&input=VzQrT1dSMHJjTjJjY2xreFNJV0pCQzBwWVFNRlpYYmVQc1crR3JKRmo2Z2ZSTlYxbFh5NnkzaFVLaEk4TTJUdWxtNFJXOVJabldLbE50L1pwVGZhQjgySXJ4NXduWWRnNGtpbFpJRHpBQjlITmsrNWhucWdxYW0vdWhxYml4SWJPVDhPeGVSc1FaOHBkMTZxTWcrdi9BPT0>):

```
Key: acfaaf03622106a652c4d7a3b7d5703161c0ea0fbe15a7fc75f31fa68ebcad86
IV : 957c4c3f3435548089a5f70d76a7331 (only the first half since an IV is 16 bytes)
```

Output:

```
[ID: h@$h_c011i?i0n] It is a tiger. It is also a leopard. It is the route to a chilling glimpse of hell.
```

We've now gotten the first part of the flag: `h@$h_c011i?i0n`.

The back portion gives us a hint to where the target location is.

> It is a tiger. It is also a leopard. It is the route to a chilling glimpse of
> hell.

If you google the string, you would find Haw Par Villa, for which the postal
code is `118628`.

When we try those together, it works!

`WH2022{h@$h_c011i$i0n_118628}`
