## Solution

_Solved by [@skytect](https://github.com/skytect) and
([@fishjojo1](https://github.com/fishjojo1))_

Essentially this is just an interactive `cd` game that you can play.

Just remember,

```bash
cd foo       # enter directory 'foo'
cd /foo/bar  # enter directory '/foo/bar'
cd ..        # go up one directory
cd /         # go to root directory
```
