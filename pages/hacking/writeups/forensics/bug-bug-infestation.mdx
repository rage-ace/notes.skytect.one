# Bug Bug Infestation

## Description

CTF: Whitehacks 2021

Our employee has been complaining of strange PDF files been downloaded onto his
laptop. As a reactive measure, our forensics team have setup network monitoring
to capture any strange network behaviour coming from his laptop.

Investigate this pcap file and find evidence of a possible BugBug Malware
Infection?

## Solution

If we look through the pcap file, it seems like there are some files being
transferred over `HTTP`. We can filter them out using
`File > Export Objects > HTTP`.

When we look at the packets in `PDF_1.pdf`, we notice something peculiar at the
end of the file...

At the end of every `PDF` file, there appears to be some fragments of a `PNG`
file in between `%BUG` delimiters. When we reconstruct the `PNG` file, we are
able to get an image of the flag.
