We have received a file from the aliens, but it got malformed halfway during
transmission. Can you retrieve the flag from this file?

## Solution

_Solved by [@skytect](https://github.com/skytect)_

Just strings it.

```bash
$ strings get_rickrolled.mp4 | grep 'WH2022'
WH2022{5tr1ng_m3_up_b3f0r3_y0u_g0_go}
```

`WH2022{5tr1ng_m3_up_b3f0r3_y0u_g0_go}`
