# The Indecipherable Cipher

## Description

Author: WickedEye (Ying Keat)

Difficulty: Easy

Some say this cipher cannot be deciphered. Well, do you believe them?

Even worse, some say this cipher is misattributed!

I would say that the key to solving this challenge is to remember who the true
inventor was.

Looking at the ciphertext, one can see that it's some form of cipher that
substitutes letters. Immediately, one thinks of
[ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) and the
[Vignère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipher).

The Vignère cipher just happens to be misattributed! However, the cipher
requires a key which is hard to guess with just the cryptic ciphertext.

From [the Wikipedia site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipher), we can
find that the first guy who came up with the cipher is Giovan Battista Bellaso.

If we try to decrypt it on [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) with
the key `GIOVAN`, it works!
