> maybe you walk through it

Try `binwalk`?

```bash
$ binwalk treasure.pdf

Cool now let's `foremost` it to extract all the files nicely.

```bash
$ foremost -i treasure.pdf
```

After looking through the `output` folder, you would find a sus image in `output/jpg/00000002.jpg` with the flag:

![image with flag](/images/whitehacks-2022/garbage-runner-1.jpg)

`WH2022{m0r3_th4n_m33t5_th3_3y3}`
