This is relatively straightforward. First, google `SG Cyber Youth Odyssey`. After clicking on [https://www.csa.gov.sg/sgcyberyouthodyssey](https://www.csa.gov.sg/sgcyberyouthodyssey), one can find more details about the programme.

> The **four stages** of the learning roadmap,

There seems to be `4` stages.

The programme at the 'Excel' stage seems to be `SGCyberOlympians`.

> c. How many project tiers does the SG Cyber Talent Development Fund support?

It is probably a number less than five. Let's just try random numbers until we get there. Oh look, `3` works!

Combining the parts, you get `4_SGCyberOlympians_3`, which is the flag.

`WH2022{4_SGCyberOlympians_3}`
