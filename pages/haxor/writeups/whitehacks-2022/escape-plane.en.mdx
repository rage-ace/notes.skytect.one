The title tells us that this has something to do with bit planes. As with all stego challs, let's dump it into [aperisolve.fr](https://aperisolve.fr).

We get the following image:

If we scan the QR codes, we get:

```
R: _t00}
G: WH2022{rGb_
B: h1d3s_1nf0
```

Combining those together, we get the flag.

`WH2022{rGb_h1d3s_1nf0_t00}`
